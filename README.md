extendscript
============

This repo will be the home for my research and documentation on Adobe Extendscript.  
#[Have a look at the wiki](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript/wiki)  
For more script snippets look at my [after-effects-script-snippets](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/after-effects-script-snippets) or my [IDSnippets](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/IDSnippets) repositories.

In some time I will add more code examples in here.  

##TOC
