extendscript
============

This repo will be the home for my research and documentation on Adobe Extendscript. Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/extendscript/wiki). In some time I will add more code examples in here.  

TOC  

##InDesign  
- Graphics/copy-graphic-from-rect-to-tect.jsx (copies an iamge from one rectangle to another)  
- MasterSpreads/master-spreads-set-properties.jsx (setting some masterspread properties)  
- Properties/set-properties-with-loop.jsx (sets properties without using properties. The good thing about it? you can use JSON and he still processes only properties the ID DOM Object has)

##Script UI  
- Progress-And-Delay.jsx (Shows the usage of progressbars and a delay function)
